based on the architecture including the auth, if we applied kong as the api gateway, what would be the protocol and architecture for authentication?

is it:

A. there is no need for JWT validation for most of the services (no authentication.py), it's handled by the api gateway, the services trust API gateway
B. do we keep current design where each services validates the jwt cookie

since every service uses authentication.py, how drastic will the changes be?

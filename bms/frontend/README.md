- Also, I can't revise our dropdown code like its data in selection because it's inside the API, so when i revising it, the API Calls and the backend that are attached is being destroy, so I can't even change it. Also, when i put the dropdown codes into components file our code is becoming white screen, so it's hard to risk.
